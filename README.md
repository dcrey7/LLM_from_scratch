**Recommended Approach:** Start with Label Studio for its active learning capabilities and ML backend integration 

## **Computational Requirements**

### **Hardware Specifications**

**Minimum Setup:**

- Single consumer GPU (RTX 4090 24GB)   for LoRA fine-tuning of 7B models
- 24GB VRAM minimum for 7B model fine-tuning 

**Recommended Setup:**

- Multi-GPU setup with A100 (40GB) or H100 (80GB)  for larger models and faster training
- Memory-efficient techniques like SlimFit can reduce GPU requirements by 2-3x 

**Cost-Effective Options:**

- Cloud platforms (AWS, Google Colab Pro, Lambda Labs) for experimentation
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods  to reduce computational requirements

### **Memory Optimization Techniques**

- LoRA reduces trainable parameters by 10,000x 
- QLoRA for 4-bit quantization 
- Gradient accumulation for effective larger batch sizes
