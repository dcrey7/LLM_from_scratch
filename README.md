Excellent question! Let’s explore what happens when we convert GPT-2’s causal attention to bidirectional attention. This is essentially transforming it from a decoder to an encoder architecture.

## Current Causal Mask in Your Code

```python
# In MultiHeadAttention
self.register_buffer('mask', torch.triu(torch.ones(context_length, context_length), diagonal=1))
# This creates upper triangular matrix with 1s above diagonal

# During forward pass:
mask_bool = self.mask.bool()[:num_tokens, :num_tokens]
attn_scores.masked_fill_(mask_bool, -torch.inf)
```

## Making it Bidirectional

To make it bidirectional, we’d remove the masking:

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_in, d_out, context_length, dropout, num_heads, qkv_bias=False):
        super().__init__()
        # ... other initializations ...
        # REMOVE THIS LINE:
        # self.register_buffer('mask', torch.triu(torch.ones(context_length, context_length), diagonal=1))

    def forward(self, x):
        # ... compute attention scores ...
        
        # REMOVE THESE LINES:
        # mask_bool = self.mask.bool()[:num_tokens, :num_tokens]
        # attn_scores.masked_fill_(mask_bool, -torch.inf)
        
        # Just apply softmax directly
        attn_weights = torch.softmax(attn_scores / keys.shape[-1]**0.5, dim=-1)
```

## Major Issues and Impacts

### 1. **Generation Becomes Impossible**

The most critical issue - autoregressive generation breaks completely:

```python
# This won't work properly anymore:
def generate_text_simple(model, idx, max_new_tokens, context_size):
    for _ in range(max_new_tokens):
        logits = model(idx_cond)
        logits = logits[:, -1, :]  # Taking last token's prediction
        # Problem: This last token now "sees" all future positions!
```

**Why it breaks:**

- Token at position N can now see tokens at positions N+1, N+2, etc.
- During training, the model learns to “cheat” by looking at future tokens
- At inference, there ARE no future tokens, so predictions become nonsensical

### 2. **Training Objective Mismatch**

Your current loss function assumes next-token prediction:

```python
# Current training:
# Input:  [A, B, C, D]
# Target: [B, C, D, E]
# Each position predicts the NEXT token
```

With bidirectional attention:

- Token B can see C, D, E during training
- It becomes trivial to “predict” the next token - just look at it!
- Loss will drop artificially low during training
- Model learns to copy rather than predict

### 3. **Information Leakage**

During training, severe information leakage occurs:

```python
# Example sequence: "The cat sat on the mat"
# Predicting "sat" after "cat":
# - Causal: Only sees "The cat"
# - Bidirectional: Sees "The cat [?] on the mat"
# The model can infer "sat" from surrounding context!
```

### 4. **Loss Function Becomes Meaningless**

```python
def calc_loss_batch(input_batch, target_batch, model, device):
    logits = model(input_batch)  # Now each position sees all positions
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.flatten(0, 1), target_batch.flatten())
    # This loss is now trivial to minimize!
```

## What You’d Need to Change

### Option 1: Switch to BERT-style Training (Masked Language Modeling)

```python
def create_mlm_batch(input_batch, tokenizer, mask_prob=0.15):
    # Randomly mask 15% of tokens
    masked_batch = input_batch.clone()
    labels = torch.full_like(input_batch, -100)  # -100 = ignore in loss
    
    # Create random mask
    mask = torch.rand(input_batch.shape) < mask_prob
    
    # Replace with [MASK] token
    masked_batch[mask] = tokenizer.encode('[MASK]')[0]
    labels[mask] = input_batch[mask]
    
    return masked_batch, labels

# New loss calculation:
def calc_mlm_loss(masked_input, labels, model, device):
    logits = model(masked_input)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)), labels.view(-1), 
                          ignore_index=-100)
    return loss
```

### Option 2: Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks

Transform the model for encoder tasks:

- Text classification: Add a classification head
- Token classification (NER): Classify each token
- Sentence encoding: Use [CLS] token representation

### Option 3: Keep Some Causal Properties

Create a hybrid approach:

```python
def hybrid_attention_mask(seq_len, num_causal):
    # First num_causal positions use causal mask
    # Remaining positions use bidirectional
    mask = torch.zeros(seq_len, seq_len)
    mask[:num_causal, :num_causal] = torch.triu(torch.ones(num_causal, num_causal), diagonal=1)
    return mask
```

## Practical Example of What Goes Wrong

Let me show you what would happen with your current code:

```python
# Training data: "Every effort moves you forward"
# Current causal training:
# Position 0 ("Every"): Predicts "effort" seeing only [START]
# Position 1 ("effort"): Predicts "moves" seeing only "Every"
# Position 2 ("moves"): Predicts "you" seeing only "Every effort"

# With bidirectional (broken):
# Position 0 ("Every"): Predicts "effort" seeing "? effort moves you forward"
# Position 1 ("effort"): Predicts "moves" seeing "Every ? moves you forward"
# The model just learns to look at the next position!
```

## Recommended Approach for Bidirectional

If you want bidirectional attention for NER (from your project description), you need:

1. **Change the training objective:**

```python
class GPTForTokenClassification(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, gpt_model, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.gpt = gpt_model  # Your modified bidirectional GPT
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(gpt_model.config['emb_dim'], num_classes)
    
    def forward(self, input_ids):
        # Get representations for all tokens
        hidden_states = self.gpt(input_ids)  # (batch, seq_len, hidden_dim)
        # Classify each token
        logits = self.classifier(hidden_states)  # (batch, seq_len, num_classes)
        return logits
```

1. **New training loop for NER:**

```python
# Labels for each token: O, B-PER, I-PER, B-LOC, etc.
def train_ner(model, dataloader, optimizer):
    for input_ids, labels in dataloader:  # labels shape: (batch, seq_len)
        logits = model(input_ids)
        loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.reshape(-1, num_classes), labels.reshape(-1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

Would you like me to show how to modify your current code to support bidirectional attention for NER while keeping the option for causal generation?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
